# DABSquaredPushNotificationsBundle ![](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bassrock499/DABSquaredPushNotificationsBundle.png)


A bundle to allow sending of push notifications to mobile devices.  Currently supports Android (C2DM, GCM), Blackberry, Safari and iOS devices. The Base framework is imported from https://github.com/richsage/RMSPushNotificationsBundle

Any contributions are welcome. The goal here is to provide an interface for push notifications with device registration and user device pairing just like FOSCommentBundle, but with very little code to write.

V1.0:
  * Support Basic Device Registration for iOS Devices
  * Be able to associate a device with a user much like FOSCommentBundle
  * Be able to send messages to a particular device or user, using about 2-4 lines of code.
  * Auto-manage badge numbers. 

V1.1:
  * Safari Push Notifications

V2.0:
  * Support Device Registration for Android (Accepting Pull Requests)
  * Support Device Registration for Blackberry (Accepting Pull Requests)
  * Support Device Registration for Mac Apps (Accepting Pull Requests)
  * Push Notification read receipts and statistics like UrbanAirship.
    * As of V1.0 this data is being reported back from iOS devices.
  * Create A Dashboard
