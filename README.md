# DABSquaredPushNotificationsBundle ![](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bassrock499/DABSquaredPushNotificationsBundle.png)

A bundle to allow sending of push notifications to mobile devices.  Currently supports Android (C2DM, GCM), Blackberry and iOS devices. The Base framework is imported from https://github.com/richsage/RMSPushNotificationsBundle

Almost Ready for Use.. Any contributions are welcome. The goal here is to provide an interface for push notifications with device registration and user device pairing just like FOSCommentBundle.


Road Map:

V1.0:
  Support Basic Device Registration for iOS Devices (at least)   - WORKING
  Be able to associate a device with a user much like FOSCommentBundle   - WORKING
  Be able to send messages to a particular device or user, using about 2-4 lines of code.  - WORKING
  Auto-manage badge numbers.   WORKING, NEEED TO ADD DOCUMENTATION FOR HOW TO SUPPORT.

V1.1:
  Full Support for all types of Device Push Notifications

V2.0:
  Push Notification read receipts and statistics like UrbanAirship.

You can add as many certificates as you need. Also note that the bundle will send using certificates that match the internal_app_ids of the registered devices.
