Step 2: Create your Device and Message classes
==============================================

The DABSquaredPushNotificationsBundle supports both Doctrine ODM (mongodb) and Doctrine ORM by
default. However, you must provide a concrete Device and Message class. Follow
the appropriate instructions to set up the classes:

- [Doctrine ORM](2a-mapping_orm.md)
- [Doctrine ODM (mongodb)](2b-mapping_mongodb.md)

### Continue to the next step!
When you're done. Continue with importing the routing:
