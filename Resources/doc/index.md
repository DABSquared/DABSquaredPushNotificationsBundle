Getting Started With DABSquaredPushNotificationsBundle
=====================================

## Installation

Installation is a quick (I promise!) 3 step process:

1. [Setting up the bundle](1-setting_up_the_bundle.md)
2. [Create your Device and Message classes](2-create_your_device_and_message_classes.md)
3. [Importing DABSquaredPushNotificationsBundle routing](3-importing_dabpushnotificationsbundle_routing.md)

## Optional next steps

The following steps are optional and the order doesn't matter:

- [Integration with FOSUserBundle](4-integrating_with_fosuserbundle.md)
- [Integration with iOS](5-integration_with_ios.md)
